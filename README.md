# PDSportal

## Overview

Drug side effects in children were mined from openFDA, the publicly available repository of the FDA. This is the first resource of 460,837 adverse drug events (ADEs) with estimated risk across child development stages. 

## This application

This R shinydashboard application is the publically accessible web application of our resource. 

The goal of the Pediatric Drug Safety portal (PDSportal) is to access our generated database to easily identify and evaluate evidence for adverse drug events in the pediatric population.

## Database download links

You can download this (unzip first) and place it in the data/ folder to use the app locally:
